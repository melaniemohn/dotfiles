The `sublime` directory contains Preferences and Package Control settings (both of which should live in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`), as well as a few language-specific settings that (I assume?) were created by [this package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Naomi), which I use for better syntax highlighting. Not sure why that's not listed in Package Control.
