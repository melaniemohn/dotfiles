The `sublime` directory contains Preferences and Package Control settings (both of which should live in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`), as well as a few language-specific settings that (I assume?) were created by [this package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Naomi), which I use for better syntax highlighting. Not sure why that's not listed in Package Control.

`Brewfile` reflects the result of running `brew bundle dump` (I know, right?) for command line apps, and then adding any necessary Mac apps. These can be installed with a quick and dirty `brew bundle install`. [Read more](https://www.caseyliss.com/2019/10/8/brew-bundle), or [see the docs](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle).
